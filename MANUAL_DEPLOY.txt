MANUAL DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
==============================

When your server becomes accessible, run these commands:

1. Upload files (from your local machine):
   scp pwa-complete-deploy.tar.gz extract-complete-pwa.sh iii@157.173.124.19:~/

2. SSH to server:
   ssh iii@157.173.124.19

3. Deploy PWA:
   chmod +x extract-complete-pwa.sh
   ./extract-complete-pwa.sh

4. Quick fix for loading issue (if step 3 fails):
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/app.rootuip.com
   
   Add before the final closing brace:
   
   location = /api/metrics {
       add_header Content-Type application/json;
       return 200 '{"activeShipments":127,"onTimeDelivery":"94.2","ddRiskScore":"2.8","costSavings":142}';
   }
   
   Then:
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl reload nginx

Files prepared:
- pwa-complete-deploy.tar.gz (Complete PWA package)
- extract-complete-pwa.sh (Automated deployment script)
- mini-deploy.sh (Minimal fix for loading issue)
