**Response**: "94.2% accuracy means $14M+ saved per vessel. The 5.8% we miss? Still caught by your team, but 94.2% never happen."

### "Integration complexity"
**Response**: "Live demo shows Maersk integration ready. Microsoft SSO works today. 2-week deployment, not 6 months."

### "Cost justification"
**Response**: "Average client prevents $2.5M in charges monthly. Platform cost: $50K/month. ROI in first prevented charge."
