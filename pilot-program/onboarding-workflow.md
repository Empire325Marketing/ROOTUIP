## Phase 4: Success Metrics Definition

### Business Metrics Framework

**Primary KPIs**:
1. **D&D Prevention Rate**
   - Target: 94%
   - Calculation: (Shipments without D&D / High-risk shipments) Ã— 100

2. **Cost Savings**
   - Target: 20% reduction
   - Calculation: Baseline D&D costs - Current D&D costs

3. **ROI Achievement**
   - Target: 5:1
   - Calculation: (Savings + Efficiency gains) / Pilot investment

**Secondary KPIs**:
1. **User Adoption**
   - Target: >75% daily active users
   - Measurement: Unique logins per day

2. **Prediction Accuracy**
   - Target: >90%
   - Validation: Predicted vs. actual outcomes

3. **Operational Efficiency**
   - Target: 30% reduction in manual reviews
   - Measurement: Time saved on D&D management

### Baseline Establishment

**Week 0 Data Collection**:
```python
# Baseline metrics collection script
baseline_metrics = {
    "monthly_dd_charges": [],
    "dd_incident_rate": 0,
    "avg_dd_duration": 0,
    "manual_review_hours": 0,
    "missed_prevention_opportunities": 0,
    "current_prevention_methods": [],
    "team_size": 0,
    "technology_costs": 0
}

# Calculate baseline over last 12 months
for month in last_12_months:
    metrics = collect_monthly_metrics(month)
    baseline_metrics["monthly_dd_charges"].append(metrics["dd_charges"])
    # ... continue for all metrics

baseline_report = generate_baseline_report(baseline_metrics)
```
