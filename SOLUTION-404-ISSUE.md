# SOLVED: The 404 Issue Explained

## The Real Problem
**The domain rootuip.com is pointing to a DIFFERENT SERVER (145.223.73.4), not this one!**

- This server's IP: 24.44.95.254
- rootuip.com points to: 145.223.73.4
- That's why you get 404s - you're hitting a different server!

## Proof
When I test locally with the correct Host header, the files work:
```bash
curl -H "Host: rootuip.com" http://localhost/ml-demo.html
# Returns the HTML content successfully!
```

## Solutions

### Option 1: Update DNS (Recommended)
Update your DNS records to point rootuip.com to this server:
- Change A record for rootuip.com from 145.223.73.4 to 24.44.95.254
- Change A record for www.rootuip.com to 24.44.95.254
- Add A record for app.rootuip.com to 24.44.95.254

### Option 2: Local Testing Only
Add this to your local computer's hosts file:
```
24.44.95.254 rootuip.com www.rootuip.com app.rootuip.com
```

- Windows: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
- Mac/Linux: /etc/hosts

### Option 3: Access Directly by IP
Access the demos using the IP address directly:
- http://24.44.95.254/ml-demo.html
- http://24.44.95.254/login.html
- http://24.44.95.254/enterprise-security-dashboard.html

### Option 4: Deploy to the Correct Server
The files need to be deployed to the server at 145.223.73.4 where rootuip.com actually points.

## What's Happening Now
1. Your browser goes to rootuip.com
2. DNS resolves to 145.223.73.4 (wrong server)
3. That server doesn't have the new files
4. You get 404 errors

## All Services ARE Working
On THIS server (24.44.95.254):
- ✅ Nginx is configured correctly
- ✅ All files are in the right place
- ✅ ML system is running
- ✅ Auth system is running
- ✅ Static server is running

The only issue is the DNS is pointing to the wrong server!
