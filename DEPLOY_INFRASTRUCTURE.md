# Infrastructure Platform Deployment Guide

## Overview
The enterprise-grade infrastructure platform for UIP has been built with the following components:

1. **Cloud Architecture Dashboard** - Multi-region deployment monitoring
2. **Security Center** - Zero-trust security and compliance tracking
3. **Data Management Platform** - Data lake and governance controls
4. **Integration Platform** - API gateway and developer portal
5. **Monitoring & Observability** - Real-time metrics and alerting

## Files Location
All files are in: `/home/iii/ROOTUIP/infrastructure/`

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Using SCP (Recommended)
```bash
# On your local machine:
cd /home/iii/ROOTUIP
scp -r infrastructure/ root@145.223.73.4:/var/www/html/
```

### Option 2: Using the tar archive
```bash
# Archive is already created at: /home/iii/ROOTUIP/infrastructure.tar.gz

# Copy to VPS:
scp infrastructure.tar.gz root@145.223.73.4:/var/www/html/

# On VPS:
cd /var/www/html
tar -xzf infrastructure.tar.gz
rm infrastructure.tar.gz
```

### Option 3: Using rsync
```bash
rsync -avz /home/iii/ROOTUIP/infrastructure/ root@145.223.73.4:/var/www/html/infrastructure/
```

### Option 4: Manual transfer via FTP client
Use any FTP client to upload the `infrastructure` folder to `/var/www/html/` on your VPS.
